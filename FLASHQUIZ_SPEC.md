## Question Syntax

Questions are defined using specific markers followed by the question text and answer details.

### Markers

| Marker   | Type                  | Answer Format        |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `@mc`    | Multiple Choice       | `= b`                |
| `@sata`  | Select All That Apply | `= a, c, e`          |
| `@tf`    | True/False            | `= true` / `= false` |
| `@fib`   | Fill in the Blank     | `= answer1, answer2` |
| `@match` | Matching              | Left \| Right pairs  |
| `@sa`    | Short Answer          | `= text`             |
| `@la`    | Long Answer           | `= text`             |

### Standard Rules

1.  **Marker**: Start a question with `@type` (e.g., `@mc`).
2.  **Options**: Use `a)`, `b)`, `c)`... for choices (lowercase letters followed by a parenthesis).
3.  **Answer**: Use the `=` prefix followed by a space (e.g., `= a`).
4.  **Multiple Answers**: Separate multiple answers with a comma and space (e.g., `= a, c`).
5.  **Question Separator**: Questions should be separated by a blank line or the next marker.
